# Performance notes

Measurements that closed a question, kept because the question comes back.

Each of these was an idea that sounded right. Two of them are not shipped, and
the reason they are not is a number rather than an opinion — which is the point
of writing them down: without this file the same idea is proposed again next
year and measured again from scratch.

## How these numbers were taken

Every figure below is from this repository's own tests, run on an otherwise idle
machine, and the second half of that sentence had to be learned. The netns
harnesses used to leave the engine processes they started running as orphans —
a day of matrix runs had left 324 of them holding six and a half gigabytes — and
measurements taken beside them were quietly wrong in both directions. The
harnesses reap what they start now (`tools/*test/*.sh`), and every number here
was re-taken afterwards.

If a figure here disagrees with one you measure, check what else is running
before concluding anything about the code.

## Where the time actually goes

Two profiles, taken 2026-09-22.

**A tunnel under sustained load** (the soak: 650,000 round trips through a real
tunnel over loopback):

```
59%  syscalls
 9%  runtime.nanotime
 4%  runtime.futex
```

**The layer-3 data path on its own** (seal, parse, open, at full MTU):

```
62%  chacha20poly1305Seal      (assembly)
16%  chacha20poly1305Open      (assembly)
 3%  session.sealKind          (Go)
 6%  allocation
```

So the product spends its time in the kernel and in hand-written crypto
assembly. That single fact decides most of what follows.

## Profile-guided optimisation: measured, not shipped

Go's PGO works by using a profile to guide inlining and devirtualisation of
**Go** code. Given the two profiles above there is very little Go code to guide:
the tunnel is syscalls, and the data path is assembly in `x/crypto` that the Go
compiler does not touch.

Measured anyway, with the data-path profile as `default.pgo`, three runs each:

| | without | with |
|---|---|---|
| seal, full MTU | 856 ns/op | 883 ns/op |
| full round trip | 1725 ns/op | 1690 ns/op |

Both differences are inside run-to-run variance, and they point in opposite
directions. There is no gain here to ship, and a committed `default.pgo` is a
file that has to be regenerated and re-justified on every release.

**Revisit if** the balance changes — a pure-Go crypto path on an architecture
without assembly, or a workload where the Go relay code dominates rather than
the kernel.

## splice: measured, not turned on by default

`splice` saves a copy between two sockets and the kernel.

| | throughput |
|---|---|
| buffered | 8,419 Mbit/s |
| splice | 10,813 Mbit/s |

+28%, on loopback, for plain `tcp` with no bandwidth limit — and loopback
*understates* it, because the copy splice avoids is cheap there and the syscall
overhead dominates. A gain here is conservative; a loss would have been damning.

It is still off by default, and that is the recorded decision rather than an
absence of one. A synthetic gain shows the implementation works, not that it
should become everybody's default on upgrade. What would justify flipping it is
the same measurement on a real link. Reproduce with:

```
go test ./internal/e2e/ -run TestSpliceThroughput -v -count=1
```

## recvmmsg: measured, shipped

40,000 datagrams of 1200 bytes at a loopback carrier:

| | received | rate |
|---|---|---|
| one at a time | 27,682 of 40,000 | 59 kpps |
| recvmmsg | 40,000 of 40,000 | 214 kpps |

The rate is the smaller half of that result. Reading one at a time, the receive
loop could not keep up with the sender and the socket dropped nearly a third of
the datagrams. A tunnel losing packets inside its own receive loop is
indistinguishable from a lossy path when you are looking at it from outside,
which is the most expensive kind of fault to chase.

Linux only, plain `udp` carrier only. Every other carrier reads as it did
before, including if the batch path refuses at runtime — losing the
optimisation costs throughput, never the tunnel.

## sendmmsg: measured, shipped, and the number is not the point

The transmit half of the same mechanism. 40,000 datagrams of 1200 bytes at a
loopback carrier, three runs each:

| | syscalls | rate (median of 3) |
|---|---|---|
| one at a time | 40,000 | 254 kpps |
| sendmmsg | 5,000 | 260 kpps |

**Eight times fewer syscalls for the same throughput.** Read that as the
expected shape rather than a disappointment: on loopback the syscall is not what
costs, the copy and the sink are, so removing seven eighths of the syscalls buys
nothing measurable here. It costs nothing either — and on a real NIC, where the
syscall and the driver path *are* the cost, the same change is what the receive
side measured as 59 → 214 kpps once that path was genuinely loaded.

It is shipped on those terms: same throughput, far less work, and the direction
of the remaining uncertainty is the one that favours it.

The send path was already reading a *batch* from the TUN — the kernel hands over
however many packets it had ready — and then writing each one with its own
syscall. The gather costs nothing to arrange: the packets are already there,
already sealed, already going to the same peer.

## UDP segmentation offload: measured, shipped, and the number *is* the point

`sendmmsg` removed seven eighths of the syscalls on the layer-3 send path and
bought no measurable throughput, which is the row above. The conclusion drawn
from it was the right one and it was only half the story: the cost is not the
syscall, it is **per datagram inside the kernel** — a copy into the socket
buffer and a walk down the protocol stack, once each, for every datagram.
Batching the calls does nothing about that.

`UDP_SEGMENT` does. One buffer and a segment size go in, the kernel cuts the
buffer up, and the copy and the stack walk happen once for the whole run.

40,000 datagrams of 1,200 bytes to a drained loopback sink, three runs, with an
unconnected socket and an explicit destination — the same shape the carrier has,
because a connected socket measures faster and would not be measuring the thing
that could ship:

| | syscalls | rate | vs sendmmsg |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sendmmsg`, 32 per call | 1,250 | ~265 kpps | — |
| `UDP_SEGMENT`, 32 per call | 1,250 | ~1,050 kpps | **+206% … +377%** |
| `UDP_SEGMENT`, 48 per call | 834 | ~1,170 kpps | +264% … +414% |

**The middle row is the one that decided it.** Same batch, same number of
syscalls, three to four times the rate — so the gain is the offload itself and
not the batch size.

The third row is not just a curiosity: the TUN hands the send pump whatever the
kernel had ready, which is far more than eight, so the carrier splits a batch
into as many segmented writes as it can rather than taking one and refusing the
rest. A run ends at the first packet of a different size, at the kernel's
segment ceiling, or at the edge of one UDP payload — and a *short* packet does
not merely end a run, it is that run's last segment, because the kernel's
remainder is the final datagram. So a batch of full-sized packets with an
acknowledgement in the middle of it goes out as two segmented writes rather than
as none.

Shipped with two conditions, both in `internal/tunnel/l3/gso.go`:

- **Every segment but the last must be the same size.** That is the mechanism,
  not the implementation. A run of full-sized packets — a transfer through the
  tunnel — qualifies; the ragged traffic in between does not and takes the
  `sendmmsg` path exactly as before. The optimisation therefore applies where
  the tunnel is busiest, which is the right place for it.
- **Support is found out by trying.** It depends on the kernel, the family and
  the route, and there is no reliable way to ask first. The first refusal turns
  it off for the life of the socket and the same batch goes out the old way,
  so nothing is dropped and nothing keeps paying for a probe that has failed.

`TestGSOSendRate` is the measurement and it is kept, so the next person to ask
gets a number from their own machine.

**Shipped, and until v1.8.5 not reached.** The default `udp` carrier was wrapped
in a peer-pinning layer that exposed neither batch method, so recvmmsg, sendmmsg
and `UDP_SEGMENT` above ran only in their own tests; every production packet was
its own system call. v1.8.5 hands a single path to the tunnel unwrapped
(`TestTheDefaultUDPCarrierReachesTheBatchPaths` holds it there), and a live tunnel between two
network namespaces shows the offload working: 5 MB through the tunnel left the
dialling engine in 168 `sendmsg` calls for about 4,000 datagrams — some 24
segments a call — and no `sendmmsg` fallback at all.

## How wide a receive batch, and how many readers

Two questions about the layer-3 receive path, asked together because the second
one only makes sense once the first is answered. `TestBatchWidth` and
`TestReadersPerSocket` are both kept.

**The batch was eight and eight was an argument, not a measurement.** Four
widths, three runs, 40,000 datagrams of 1,200 bytes:

```
width   1    ~50 kpps, and only half the datagrams arrive
width   8   ~225 kpps
width  32   ~300 kpps
width 128   ~275 kpps
```

It is now thirty-two, and thirty-two is the peak rather than a compromise: a
hundred and twenty-eight is no faster and sometimes slower, while costing 900 KB
more of buffers per tunnel.

The interesting part is not the rate. The batch rarely *fills* at any width —
two to four datagrams per call, because the reader keeps up — so the gain is not
in gathering more, it is in taking an occasional burst in one call rather than
two. And in the first row: a reader taking one datagram at a time cannot keep up
at all, and the socket drops nearly half of them.

**One reading goroutine is not the bottleneck any deployment will meet.** With
four senders pushing at once it takes 500–800 kpps and loses nothing. At
1,200-byte inner packets that is five to eight gigabits a second of tunnelled
traffic.

**And the mechanism usually proposed for raising it does not apply here.**
`SO_REUSEPORT` with N sockets distributes incoming datagrams across them **by
flow**, and a layer-3 tunnel has exactly one flow: one peer, one source port.
Every datagram hashes the same way, so N sockets would leave N-1 of them idle.
That is a property of the protocol, not of this implementation.

What is left is N goroutines reading the *same* socket, which the kernel allows
and serialises. Measured, three runs, one/two/four readers against the same
load: two and four are never faster than one and are usually slower. The
serialisation is the ceiling, and adding goroutines adds contention to reach it.

So the receive path stays one reader. The number to remember is the one that
makes it a non-question: a tunnel would have to be carrying several gigabits a
second before the reader was what limited it.

## Batching the reverse relay: there is nothing to gather

The layer-3 carrier gained `recvmmsg` and `sendmmsg`, and the obvious next
question was the reverse relay: it copies connection by connection and nothing
gathers. The answer is that the gather has already happened, in the kernel,
before the relay sees the data.

Measured on a saturated stream — 256 MB through a relay loop the same shape as
`handlers.transferData`, with the same 64 KB buffer:

```
4,501 reads for 256 MB
  full 64 KB buffer   3,942 reads   87.6%
  8–16 KB               428 reads    9.5%
  everything else       131 reads    2.9%
```

Nearly nine reads in ten already come back with the buffer full. There is no
batching to add: one read and one write per 64 KB is the floor for a stream, and
`splice` removes even the copy between them where both ends are plain TCP.

The remaining tenth is the interesting part, and it is the argument against
doing this rather than for it. Those are the reads that returned early because
that is all that had arrived. Gathering them means holding the first chunk until
a second one turns up — buying a syscall with latency, on a path that is already
the slow part of somebody's connection, for traffic that is small precisely
because it is interactive.

What does help at this layer has already been done and is measured above: a
64 KB buffer rather than 16 KB (a quarter of the syscalls per gigabyte), pooling
it rather than allocating per direction per connection, and `splice` where the
operator asks for it.

## Automatic MSS discovery on the reverse tunnel: not built, and why

The layer-3 engine measures its own path (`auto_mtu`). The reverse tunnel does
not, and the obvious symmetry — have every TCP connection read the path MTU the
kernel knows for its route, derive the clamp from it, and apply it — was built
and then thrown away, because it does nothing.

Measured in a network namespace with loopback narrowed to 1280 bytes, which is
the only way to get a genuinely narrow link into a unit test:

```
lo MTU = 1280
IP_MTU (what the kernel knows about the route) = 1280
the clamp that would be derived from it        = 1228
TCP_MAXSEG on the dialled socket, no clamp set = 1228
TCP_MAXSEG on the accepted socket, no clamp set = 1228
```

The clamp derived from the kernel's figure is the figure the kernel had already
chosen. That holds in every case the feature would cover:

- **The local interface is narrow.** The kernel sizes its advertised MSS from
  the outgoing interface and gets it right without help.
- **A remote hop is narrow and answers.** The ICMP "fragmentation needed" reply
  lowers the kernel's path MTU, and `snd_mss` with it. `IP_MTU` reports the
  result rather than causing it.
- **A remote hop is narrow and is silent.** This is the fault the clamp exists
  for, and it is exactly the case where `IP_MTU` still reads the local
  interface's number. A clamp derived from it would be 1448 on a path carrying
  1240 — no better than none.

What actually finds the number on a silent path is the kernel's own TCP MTU
probing, which searches downward when a connection stalls with retransmits and
no ICMP. `internal/optimize/optimize.go` has set `net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing = 1`
since before this was asked, so the discovery the feature would have added is
already running, at the only layer that can see the evidence it needs.

The part that is genuinely missing is neither of these: it is that the operator
is never *told* the kernel had to back off. Health Check reads `snd_mss` from
the live sockets and compares it to the path (`internal/manage/diagnose_path.go`
— `fromKernel`), which is the right place for that to appear.

## pck: a clock read nobody used, and batches at both ends

Profiled on 2026-09-25, a layer-3 `pck` tunnel between two network namespaces,
512 MB echoed and 16 parallel 64 MB downloads, three runs of each. `pprof`
of the loaded kharej side, before anything changed:

| Where | Share of CPU |
|---|---|
| syscalls — `sendto` on the packet socket, TUN write, packet-socket read | 54% |
| `time.Now`, almost all of it from `pckConn.peerFor` | 15% |
| ChaCha20-Poly1305, both directions | 6% |

The clock read stamped a `touched` time on every segment in both directions,
and nothing read it. On this machine's clock source a read is not the cheap
vDSO kind, which is also true of a good share of VPS hypervisors. It went, with
the per-packet `addr.String()` the peer map was keyed on:

| | one stream | CPU (Iran / kharej) |
|---|---|---|
| before | 970 Mbit/s | 18.3 / 16.5 s |
| without the clock read | 1,315 Mbit/s | 13.6 / 11.9 s |

That left the syscalls, one per segment each way. The receive side now reads
the packet socket with `recvmmsg` and hands the interface the whole batch in
one write; the device coalesces a flow's segments before the kernel's receive
path sees them. The send side uses `sendmmsg`. On one stream each is worth a
few percent — the section on sendmmsg above says why — but not on the
workload a tunnel actually carries:

| 16 parallel downloads | throughput | CPU (Iran / kharej) |
|---|---|---|
| v1.8.2 | 742 Mbit/s | 18.8 / 21.0 s |
| all three changes | **1,300 Mbit/s** | **7.5 / 11.9 s** |

The reverse `pck` transport runs under KCP, which only batches on a real UDP
socket, so it gains the clock fix alone: 545 → 631 Mbit/s on the same test.

The same batching on xdi's raw ICMP socket (x/net's `ipv4.PacketConn`, which
is recvmmsg and sendmmsg underneath) doubled it: 16 downloads 543 → 1,150
Mbit/s, 16 uploads 627 → 1,325, one stream 582 → 1,112. Sending had been 45%
of a loaded xdi tunnel's CPU. The upload figure also carries a second change:
the server's kernel answered every data-carrying Echo Request with a full-size
Echo Reply, which one iptables rule now drops (108,000 of them in a 64 MB
upload test).

One trap on the way, kept as a test (`tunstage_linux_test.go`): with offload
on, the TUN library coalesces by appending to the first packet's buffer in
place when its capacity allows. The write path staged packets back to back in
one buffer, so each had the rest of it as capacity and the append ran over the
next packet. Nothing had written more than one packet at a time before, so it
had never shown. Each packet now gets a 64 KB slot of its own.

## What is measured on every build

The numbers above are one-offs. These are gates, and they fail the build:

- **Allocation counts** on the packet path and the relay buffer pool. Exact, not
  a maximum: deterministic, unaffected by the machine, and every one of those
  paths is meant to be allocation-free or close to it.
- **A wall-clock ceiling** at roughly 3× what each path measured when the
  ceiling was set. Generous on purpose — a shared CI runner varies by more than
  any tight threshold — and it still catches the failure that actually happens,
  which is a syscall or an allocation appearing in a per-packet loop. That is an
  order of magnitude, not a margin.

Both skip under `-race`, which multiplies wall-clock time by between five and
twenty. The allocation half still runs.
