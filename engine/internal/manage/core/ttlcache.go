// A shared answer for a question that is expensive to ask and cheap to reuse.
//
// The panel polls: system stats every four seconds, the tunnel list every six,
// and the log drawer every two while it is open. Behind those polls sit forks —
// journalctl for a unit's log, Systemctl for whether a unit is running — and
// each one used to be performed per request, per tunnel. On a host with a
// handful of tunnels and a panel open on two screens that is a steady stream of
// processes, which is most of what the panel costs in CPU.
//
// Two properties matter, and the second is the one that bites without it:
//
//   - A result is reused for ttl, so polls faster than that cost nothing extra.
//   - A call arriving while an identical one is running waits for it instead of
//     starting a second. Without this, any read slower than the poll interval
//     overlaps with the next, the overlaps stack, and the load climbs on its
//     own until whatever is behind it falls over.
//
// It is the same shape as web.statsCache, which exists for the same reason on
// the same kind of endpoint.
