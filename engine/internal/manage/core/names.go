// A tunnel's role and its name are read by the listing, which is the lowest
// layer there is — so these cannot sit in the rendering and validation files
// that own the rest of their subject, or core would depend on the packages
// that depend on it.
// nameRe restricts tunnel names to characters that are safe in file paths,
// systemd unit names and the web UI (no spaces, quotes or slashes).

//
// app.ConfigPath is plain concatenation — ConfigDir + "/" + name + ".toml" —
// so a name carrying a separator names a file outside the config directory.
// Nothing local produces one: the wizard and the panel form both check the name
// on the way in. What reaches these readers unchecked is a name off the wire —
// a query parameter on /api/tunnel/settings, or the body of a node's OpSettings
// request — and neither had anything between it and the path.
//
// Both callers already require full administrative authority, so this closes a
// gap rather than an escalation. It is worth closing anyway: the check exists,
// it is one line, and the reason it was not here is that nobody wrote it down.
// ErrBadName is exported for the readers that live above this package.
