// Every configuration key must reach code that acts on it.
//
// The configuration surface is 109 keys written in three separate places — the
// struct tag in config/, the renderer that writes the TOML, and the panel form
// that collects it — with nothing until now checking that the three agree. Two
// keys have already been found that did not:
//
//   - spoof_sockbuf was validated, written to the file and read back into the
//     form, while the carrier read a different key entirely.
//   - spoof_dst_ip is documented in detail, validated as an IPv4 address,
//     written out and read back — and reaches no code at all.
//
// This is the most corrosive bug shape in this codebase, because the value
// reads back as applied: an operator who sets it sees it set, and then rules it
// out as a cause when they go looking for why nothing changed.
//
// So the invariant is checked rather than remembered. For every `toml:` key
// declared in config/, the Go field it names must be read somewhere outside
// config/ and outside the management layer that renders and validates it —
// which is to say, by something that actually does the thing.

// engineDirs are the places a setting has to reach to be doing anything. The
// management layer is deliberately excluded: writing a key to a file and
// reading it back into a form is exactly the appearance of working that this
// test exists to see through.
