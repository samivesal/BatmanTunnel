// The direct tunnel was the only one of the three kinds with no way to cap its
// TCP segment size.
//
// The reverse tunnel has had one since the failure was diagnosed there, and
// [l3] measures the path itself. Direct crosses the same Iran-to-abroad paths
// and had neither: where a path carries less than a full-sized packet and drops
// the oversized ones without an ICMP reply, the handshake and the mux's
// keepalives are small enough to arrive, so the tunnel comes up and looks
// healthy while every real transfer stalls on the first full segment. The
// socket stays ESTABLISHED throughout, so the watchdog sees nothing wrong
// either, and the operator is left restarting it by hand.
