// Two tunnels that cannot both work.
//
// A report: "I set one tunnel up, it works, I use it. Then I made a second one
// and it will not come up." Its log was an EOF on every handshake, forever, and
// one or two other people in the same chat had the same thing.
//
// Both ways of causing it are a second tunnel colliding with the first, and
// neither was refused when it was made:
//
//   - On the Iran side, two tunnels binding the same port. The second service
//     cannot bind and dies, which at least says so in its own log.
//   - On the kharej side, two tunnels dialling the same server and port. That
//     one is worse. Both start perfectly well, the server gives its single
//     control channel to whichever arrived first, and the second is refused for
//     as long as it runs — with no idea why, because a refusal used to be a
//     closed connection.
//
// The second is trivial to do by accident: copy the tunnel that works, change
// the name, and forget that the port belongs to the other end as much as to
// this one.
//
// So it is refused where it is cheap to fix — at the moment somebody types it —
// rather than discovered later from a log that says EOF.

// two different servers on the same port number are not in conflict, and only
// the pair identifies a control channel.
