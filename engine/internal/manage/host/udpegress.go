// Does UDP leave this machine at all?
//
// Every recommendation this tool makes for a lossy link is a UDP carrier — KCP,
// QUIC, plain UDP — and every one of them carries the same caveat, written
// where RecommendTransport builds it: *"KCP runs over UDP — if your provider
// throttles UDP this will be worse, not better, so test it before committing."*
//
// That sentence is an admission. The tool measured the path with TCP connects,
// concluded the link was lossy, recommended a UDP carrier, and then told the
// operator to go and find out for themselves whether UDP works — which they
// mostly cannot, because the far end refuses to answer an unauthenticated
// datagram by design and there is nothing to test against.
//
// This measures it instead. Not against the tunnel port, which cannot answer,
// but against the public resolvers that answer UDP to anybody: if a DNS query
// leaves this machine over UDP and comes back, UDP egress is not blocked. If
// none of them answer, recommending a UDP carrier is recommending something
// that cannot work, and the recommendation says so rather than hedging.
//
// # What it does not claim
//
// It answers "can UDP leave here", not "can UDP reach that port on that
// server". A provider that allows DNS and blocks everything else would pass
// this and still fail a KCP tunnel. The narrower question needs a far end that
// will answer, which needs a wire addition on both sides — see §4.1/§4.2 in
// todo.md. What this closes is the case that actually happens: a network where
// UDP does not leave at all, which today is discovered by building the tunnel
// and watching it never come up.
//
// # Why DNS and not a purpose-built responder
//
// Because it needs no infrastructure and no trust. A query to a public resolver
// is the most ordinary UDP packet on the internet, it is answered in
// milliseconds by several independent operators, and nothing about it reveals
// anything: it asks for the address of a name the operator did not choose and
// is not going to connect to.

// udpEgressProbes are the resolvers asked, in order. Three operators rather
// than one, on different networks, so that a single provider's outage or a
// single blocked address is not read as "UDP does not work here".
