// The ports this machine listens on, for the kernel to keep out of the

//
// A port the kernel may hand out as the source port of an outgoing connection
// cannot be bound by the service that owns it. That is not hypothetical: it was
// reported as a panel node that would not start on 62050, with `ss -tlnp`
// showing nothing, because the holder was an outgoing connection rather than a
// listener. Optimize no longer widens the ephemeral range over the band those
// ports sit in, and what remains inside the range is reserved by name.
//
// This is the caller's side of optimize.Apply: that package cannot read the
// tunnel list itself, because manage imports it and the dependency cannot go
// both ways.

// ReservedPorts returns every port the configured tunnels listen on locally.
//
// Over-reporting is harmless — reserving a port the kernel was never going to
// hand out costs nothing — so this errs towards including a port rather than
// reasoning about which side of a tunnel binds it.

// left of the "=" is local; the right names a service on the far side of the
