// Matching a tunnel to its other end on a managed server.
//
// This is what makes a tunnel that already exists joinable to the fleet. Every
// reach-across the panel has — carrying an edit, starting both halves, reading
// the far journal — is gated on a record of where the other end lives, and until now that record could
// only be written at the moment the panel built both ends at once. A tunnel
// made any other way was permanently outside the fleet, on a server the panel
// was otherwise managing.
//
// The matching has to be demonstrated rather than guessed, because a pairing is
// a decision about where the operator's next edit is sent.

// A client over there aimed at this machine, on this tunnel's port, is this
// tunnel's other end — whatever either of them is called.
// iranEnd is this machine's half: a reverse server bound to 3454.
