// Recognising a tunnel's other end on a server the panel manages.
//
// A tunnel built through the panel's fleet has its two ends recorded as a pair,
// and everything that reaches across — carrying an edit, starting both halves,
// reading the far journal — is gated on that record existing. A tunnel built any other way has no record, so none of
// it works, and there was no way to add one: the pairing was written in exactly
// one place, when the panel created both ends at once.
//
// That leaves every tunnel that predates the fleet permanently outside it, on a
// server the panel is otherwise managing. The fix is to be able to say "this
// tunnel's other end is that one over there" — but not by guessing, because a
// wrong pairing sends the next edit to a stranger.
//
// So it is matched on the thing the two ends genuinely share.

// PairCandidate is one tunnel on a managed server that could be the other end
// of a local one.
