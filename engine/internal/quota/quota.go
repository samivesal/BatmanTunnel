// Package quota is a tunnel's traffic limit: how many bytes it may carry in
// all, in and out together, before it stops.
//
// The limit is a file beside the tunnel's config, <name>.quota.json, and the
// count it is held against is the tunnel's own metrics total — the one that is
// carried over every restart, reload and update (metrics.NewCollector), and
// restored with a backup. Neither is reset by anything but deleting the
// tunnel, which is the point: a limit that forgot what had been used every
// time the binary was replaced would not be a limit.
//
// The engine enforces it (cmd/quota.go): it watches the total while it runs
// and ends the tunnel the moment the limit is reached, and does not start it
// again until the limit is raised. The panel writes the file and reads it back.
