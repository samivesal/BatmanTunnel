// a second admin was sharing the owner's Telegram account.

// A second account is not automatically a second owner. Most people who need to
// see whether a tunnel is up have no business restarting it, so an admin can be
// marked read-only: every screen, no actions. The distinction is enforced in
// one place, canWrite, and every action asks it.
