// What every transport has to do, checked against every transport.
//
// This suite exists because of a pattern rather than a bug. Four times in one
// week a problem was solved for one transport and left in place for the others:
//
//	controlDeadline   kcp and quic had it; the five stream transports did not
//	ReportPeer        kcp, quic and l3 had it; the five stream ones did not
//	MSS clamping      l3 had it; the direct port forwarder did not
//	port allocation   the e2e harness had solved it; the direct tests had not
//
// Each was found by hand, one at a time, after somebody reported a tunnel that
// did not work. Finding them individually does not stop the next one: the
// engines are near-copies of each other, so anything added to one is a thing
// the other six are now missing.
//
// So the properties are asserted for all of them at once. The point is not the
// three checks below — it is that the eighth engine, whenever it arrives, has
// to satisfy them before it can ship.

// engineFile maps an engine to the file that implements it. Several transports
// share one engine: stealth is tcp with a Noise layer under it, wss is ws with
// TLS, and xdi, spoof and pck are all KCP over a different carrier.
