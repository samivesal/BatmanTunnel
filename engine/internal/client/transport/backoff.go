// backoff paces reconnect attempts.

// The old behaviour retried on a fixed interval — every second, forever. On a
// route that is down for a while that is pure waste: a steady stream of dial
// attempts that also looks like a scan to anything watching. Exponential
// backoff keeps the fast recovery (the first retry is still one interval away)
// but stretches the gap as an outage persists, so a server that stays down is
// probed a handful of times a minute, not sixty.
//
// A backoff lives for one reconnect loop: it is created when the client starts
// trying to (re)establish the control channel and discarded once connected, so
// every fresh outage starts fast again.
