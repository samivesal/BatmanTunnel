// A goroutine dying during a teardown must not queue a restart of the tunnel

// Every client engine guarded its restart with `c.state.Cancel() != nil`, which
// is a condition that cannot be false: the constructor installs a cancel
// function before any of this code can run, and Reset installs another on every
// restart. So the guard was open in every case it was written to close. A
// tunnel coming down — a reload, a stop, a restart already in flight — has
// several goroutines fail at once, and each one logged an error and queued
// another Restart of a transport that was already going away.
//
// The server transports were corrected to ask their generation's own context
// instead; both sides' control loops now do (controlloop.go, read). The client
// engines kept the original, and this is the check that it does not come back —
// in an engine or in the shared lifecycle and loop.
