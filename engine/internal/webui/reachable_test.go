// Every door the panel exposes has to have something on the other side of it.
//
// This exists because the same bug was found by hand three times in one
// sitting, each time by accident:
//
//   - `nodeUpgradeAll` was exported from api.js and called from nowhere. The
//     fleet upgrade had no button at all.
//   - `nodeRolloutCancel` was added with its endpoint and never wired to
//     anything, so a rollout could be started and not stopped.
//   - the whole share-link codec is reachable from nothing but itself.
//
// None of them failed a test, none of them failed a build, and none of them
// would ever have been noticed by a person using the panel — because the way
// you notice a missing button is by looking for one, and nobody looks for a
// button they do not know should exist.
//
// The rule is narrow on purpose: an api.js export is a call the panel is meant
// to make. If nothing makes it, either the UI is missing or the export is
// dead, and both are worth a failing test.
