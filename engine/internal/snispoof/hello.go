// A TLS ClientHello built to be seen and thrown away.
//
// The technique is patterniha's, by way of the Rust implementation at
// github.com/therealaleph/sni-spoofing-rust (MIT). The idea: send a filtering
// box a ClientHello naming a domain it allows, on a connection that is really
// going somewhere else. The box reads the name, decides the flow is permitted,
// and stops looking. Sending it, and having the far end of the tunnel drop it
// before the tunnel sees it, is the sni carrier's half — see
// internal/tunnel/l3/carrier_sni.go.
//
// This file is only the message. It is a fixed 517 bytes because that is the
// size the technique was measured with: a middlebox that reassembles is being
// asked to parse one segment, and a length that varies with the domain would
// make the flows distinguishable from each other, which is the opposite of the
// point. The three random blocks are random per connection for the same
// reason — two connections that sent byte-identical hellos would stand out.
//
// Nothing here is a security boundary. The message is designed to be read.

// helloSize is what every hello weighs, whatever domain is in it.
const helloSize = 517

// maxSNI is the longest domain that still leaves room for the padding that
// brings the message up to helloSize.
const maxSNI = 219

// The parts of the template that never change: everything before the client
// random, the block between the session id and the server-name extension, and
// the block between the server name and the key share. They are a capture of a
// real modern ClientHello, so what is sent matches what a browser sends.
