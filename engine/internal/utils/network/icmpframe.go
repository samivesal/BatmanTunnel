// The framing that carries the tunnel inside ICMP echo, and keeps two tunnels
// on one host from ever touching each other's traffic.
//
// ICMP has no ports. A raw ICMP socket receives every echo packet the host
// sees — so two tunnels opened on the same machine both read the same stream of
// packets, and something other than an address has to tell one tunnel's traffic
// from the other's, from a stray ping, and from the kernel's own automatic
// replies. That something is derived from the token, which the two ends of a
// tunnel already share and no other tunnel has:
//
//   - A 4-byte session tag prefixes every packet's payload. A packet whose tag
//     is not this tunnel's is not this tunnel's packet, full stop — a different
//     tunnel's, a bare ping's, anyone's. It is dropped without a further look.
//   - The 16-bit ICMP identifier names one SESSION within the tunnel. A tunnel
//     is a control channel plus a pool of data connections, and each of those
//     is its own KCP session over its own socket — so the carrier has to be
//     able to tell them apart, and ICMP has no ports to do it with.
//
//     This is what the identifier is for in the protocol, and getting it wrong
//     stopped xdi working at all. It used to be derived from the token, which
//     made every session of a tunnel identical on the wire; kcp-go's listener
//     keys its sessions on the address the carrier reports, so all of them
//     collapsed onto one entry, and each new session closed the one before it
//     (see sess.go, "conversation id mismatched"). The control channel came up,
//     the first pool connection killed it, the reconnect killed that, and the
//     tunnel flapped forever while reporting itself connected.
//
//     So the client draws a random identifier per socket and accepts only its
//     own back; the server accepts every identifier — the tag and the direction
//     are what say the packet is this tunnel's — and reports the peer as
//     ip:identifier, which gives the listener the distinct addresses it needs.
//   - A single direction byte says which way the packet is going. This is what
//     defeats the kernel: when a client's echo request reaches the server, the
//     server's kernel answers it automatically, echoing the request's payload —
//     tag and all — straight back to the client. That reply is indistinguishable
//     from a real one by tag or identifier alone, because it carries the
//     client's own. The direction byte is not the client's: the kernel copied
//     the client's outbound marker, and the client only accepts the server's.
//     So the kernel's helpfulness is discarded and no sysctl has to be touched.
//
// None of this is a security boundary — the token still authenticates the
// tunnel through KCP's own encrypted handshake, exactly as the UDP path does.
// It is a demultiplexer, and its whole job is that the wrong packet is never
// mistaken for the right one.
