//
// It exists because a single address is a single point of failure: the server's
// IP may be filtered from the client's network while another IP, another port,
// or a CDN edge of the same server still works. The control-channel loop calls
// Rotate() every time a connection attempt fails, so the client walks the list
// until something connects — and every data connection then uses whichever
// endpoint is currently live.
//
// A one-element list behaves exactly like a plain address, so existing tunnels
// are unaffected.
