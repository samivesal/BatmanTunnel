// TCP socket tuning that applies to every TCP-based transport.

// PinTCPBuffers decides whether TCP sockets get a fixed SO_RCVBUF/SO_SNDBUF.
//
// It defaults to false, and that default is the point. Calling setsockopt for
// either buffer makes Linux mark the socket buffer-locked and stop auto-tuning
// it — the kernel will no longer grow the window to fit the path. On a link
// with real bandwidth and the usual Iran-to-abroad latency, the window the
// kernel would have chosen is far larger than any fixed value we could pick,
// so pinning a "large" 8 MB buffer actively caps throughput. Measured on a
// fast uplink, unpinning is worth several times the speed.
//
// It is worse than it looks, because Optimize raises net.ipv4.tcp_rmem's
// ceiling to 256 MB specifically so autotuning has room — and then pinning
// switched off the thing that would have used it.
//
// The datagram transports are unaffected: a UDP socket has no equivalent
// autotuning, and a big receive buffer there genuinely prevents drops under
// burst, so KCP keeps setting its own buffers on its own socket.
//
// Set true (config: so_pin_tcp) only to reproduce the old behaviour.
//
// It is read from every socket the process opens and written once from the
// engine's constructor, so it is atomic rather than a plain variable. One
// process runs one tunnel, which is why a single process-wide setting is the
// right shape — but "written before anything reads it" is a claim about
// goroutine ordering that nothing enforces, and the race detector rightly
// called it. An atomic makes it true instead of hoped for.
