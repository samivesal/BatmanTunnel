// The stealth transport.
//
// Every other transport announces itself. TLS opens with a ClientHello whose
// fingerprint a censor can recognise and block; a raw or KCP stream has its own
// tells. This one has none: the handshake is a Noise NNpsk0 exchange, so on the
// wire it is two short bursts of bytes indistinguishable from random, and the
// stream that follows is a ChaCha20-Poly1305 record layer that looks the same.
// There is nothing for deep packet inspection to match against.
//
// The pre-shared key is derived from the tunnel token, which both ends already
// hold, so the transport needs no key of its own. Because that key is mixed in
// from the very first message, a peer without the token cannot produce a message
// the responder will accept — it is dropped and nothing is sent back, so a probe
// or a port scan finds a dead port rather than a service to fingerprint.
//
// NNpsk0 gives an encrypted, mutually authenticated, forward-secret channel
// without static keys to distribute. It authenticates the peer as "holds the
// token", which is exactly the tunnel's own trust model; the token check in the
// channel handshake still runs on top, unchanged.

const (
	// noisePrologue binds the handshake transcript to this application. It never
	// travels on the wire — both ends mix it in and must agree — so a handshake
	// captured from somewhere else cannot be replayed into this one.
	noisePrologue = "backpack-noise-v1"

	// 65535-byte message ceiling less the 16-byte authentication tag.

// Hiding the shape of the traffic, not just its content.
//
// Encryption settles what is in a record; it says nothing about how big the
// record is, and record sizes are one of the few things left for an observer to
// work with on a stream they cannot read. Without padding every record is
// exactly as long as whatever the layer above handed down, so the wire carries
// a faithful transcript of the tunnel's own framing: a one-byte heartbeat, a
// token exchange of a known length, a burst of full-sized records for a
// download and small ones for an interactive session. None of that is secret in
// itself, but together it is a pattern, and a pattern is what a classifier
// needs.
//
// So each record carries a random amount of filler. Two decisions about where:
//
// The padding goes *inside* the encryption, unlike the scheme this was taken
// from, which frames the padding length in the clear and appends visible
// garbage. Padding an observer can find and subtract is not padding. Here the
// length byte and the filler are both under the AEAD, so all that reaches the
// wire is a record whose length moved.
//
// And the filler itself is left as zeroes. It is encrypted before it is sent,
// so its content is already indistinguishable from anything else; generating
// random bytes for it would cost a draw per record and buy nothing. Only the
// *length* has to be unpredictable, and that is what is drawn.
