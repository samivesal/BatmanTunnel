// The regression test for a tunnel that dropped every so often and had to be
// restarted by hand.
//
// Each of the client's pck carriers must come from its own source port: kcp-go
// demultiplexes on the sender's address alone, so two carriers sharing one port
// arrive at the server as a single peer, and a packet claiming a new
// conversation on an existing entry closes the old one. When the pool reused
// the control channel's port, it killed the control channel.
//
// The allocator was a counter taken modulo the span, which never came back
// down. It is right for the first pckPortSpan carriers and wrong for every one
// after: carrier 128 was handed carrier 0's port, and carrier 0 is the control
// channel. A pool dialling every sixteen seconds — what the field logs showed —
// reaches that in about half an hour, which is exactly how often the tunnel
// went down.
