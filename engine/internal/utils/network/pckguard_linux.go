// Keeping the host kernel out of a conversation it is not part of.
//
// The pck carrier's segments are addressed to a port nothing on the machine is
// listening on, because the listener is this process reading the wire directly.
// The kernel does not know that. It sees a TCP segment for a closed port and
// does the correct thing for a host that has no such service: it answers with a
// RST. That RST goes to the peer, and any stateful device between the two —
// which on these routes is most of them — takes it as the connection ending and
// stops passing the flow. The tunnel then dies for a reason that appears
// nowhere, having worked for a few seconds.
//
// Connection tracking is the smaller half of the same problem. Every one of
// these pseudo-flows would get a conntrack entry it will never need, and on a
// busy server that is a table filling up for nothing.
//
// Both are fixed by three narrow rules, installed for the tunnel's ports only
// and removed when the last carrier using them closes. paqet, which has the same
// problem, documents them and leaves them to the operator; there is no reason a
// tunnel that already knows its own ports cannot install them itself.
//
// The rules cover a port RANGE rather than a single port, because a client's
// pool opens one carrier per session and each needs its own source port (see
// newPckConn). They are refcounted so that a pool of sixteen installs one set of
// rules rather than sixteen.
