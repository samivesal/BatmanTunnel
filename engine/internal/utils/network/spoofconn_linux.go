// A net.PacketConn that carries the tunnel's KCP datagrams inside raw IPv4
// packets whose source address is forged — the "IP Spoofing" transport.
//
// It is the same shape as the xdi ICMP carrier: KCP, its forward error
// correction and its encryption all sit on top unchanged, because to them this
// is just a net.PacketConn like the UDP socket they usually get.
//
// The mechanism, which every working IP-spoofing tunnel shares:
//
//   - SEND is a raw socket. The packet is routed to the peer's REAL address, so
//     it genuinely arrives, but the source in the IP header is replaced with a
//     forged one. That forged source is what a stateless L3 filter sees.
//   - RECV is a separate socket. For the udp profile it is an ORDINARY UDP
//     socket, because the far end addresses its packets to this host's real IP
//     and the kernel delivers them normally. For tcp/icmp it is a raw socket,
//     since no ordinary socket would accept that framing.
//   - The far end forges ITS source too, so a reply cannot be routed by the
//     source we observe. Routing therefore always uses the peer's real address,
//     known ahead of time: the client resolves it from RemoteAddr, and the
//     server is told it (spoof_peer_ip). ReadFrom always reports that fixed real
//     peer, so KCP's replies go to the right place.
//
// The send and receive profiles are chosen independently — the "asymmetric"
// case, for a path whose filtering differs by direction. On a symmetric tunnel
// they are equal. The side (client/server) decides which of the uplink and
// downlink profiles is the send one and which the receive one.
//
// Whether a given forged source actually traverses the network is a property of
// the route, not this code. The spoof-capability tester exists to find the ones
// that do. Experimental, Linux only, and costs a raw socket (root/CAP_NET_RAW).

// spoofConn is one tunnel's carrier. Exactly one of udpRecv / rawRecv is set,
// depending on the receive profile.
