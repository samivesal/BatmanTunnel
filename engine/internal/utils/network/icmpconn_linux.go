// A net.PacketConn that carries datagrams inside ICMP echo.
//
// This is the whole of what makes the xdi transport different from kcp: KCP,
// its forward error correction and its encryption all sit on top unchanged,
// because to them this is just a net.PacketConn like the UDP socket they
// usually get. What it does underneath is wrap each outgoing datagram in an
// ICMP echo — a request from the client, a reply from the server — and unwrap
// each incoming one, dropping everything that is not this tunnel's inbound
// traffic (see icmpframe.go).
//
// It exists for the one network where UDP and TCP are filtered but ICMP is
// not — the tunnel rides in ping packets, which such a network is unwilling to
// drop because ping is how it proves itself reachable. It is experimental and
// costs a raw socket (root, or CAP_NET_RAW), so it is never a default.

// icmpSocket is the part of *icmp.PacketConn this carrier uses.
//
// It is an interface for one reason: a raw ICMP socket needs privilege, so
// nothing that opened one could be tested, and the fault that stopped xdi
// working — every session of a tunnel looking identical on the wire — lived
// for releases behind that. With the socket injectable the whole carrier runs
// against an in-memory wire, kcp-go and all. See icmpconn_linux_test.go.
