// This used to be one line that ended "both ends MUST match MTU and FEC or the

// whether or not anything was wrong. Operators read it as an error report —
// it is the only line on a healthy startup that sounds like one — and went
// looking for a fault that was not there.
//
// Worse, half of it was untrue. MTU does not have to match: kcp-go's SetMtu
// only sizes the segments this end sends, and a receiver parses whatever
// arrives, so the two ends may run different values quite happily. What MTU has
// to do is fit the path. So the advice sent people to equalise a figure that was
// never the problem, and the real fault — an MTU larger than the path carries —
// survived the change they were told to make.
//
// FEC is the parameter that genuinely must match, and it is worth saying loudly
// because the failure is total and silent. So the parameters print plainly for
// everyone, and the advice prints only for the tunnels it applies to.
// saidOnce keeps the startup notes to one telling each.
//
// They describe the run, not the connection — every session of a run is dialled
// with the same settings — but they were emitted from the dial, and a KCP
// client dials a whole pool. So a reconnect printed the parameters and the
