// The bug these guard is the one from the field logs: a spoof tunnel restarting
// to adopt a new client died with "listen udp4 0.0.0.0:58521: bind: address
// already in use". The carrier transports (spoof, xdi, pck) hand kcp-go a
// socket they built themselves, and kcp-go's NewConn2 / ServeConn deliberately
// do not take ownership of a caller-provided socket — so closing the KCP object
// left the raw socket bound, and the next restart could not rebind the port.
//
// Neither carrier can be opened without a raw socket (root), so these exercise
// the ownership contract itself with an ordinary UDP PacketConn standing in for
// the carrier. The property under test is identical: closing the KCP object
// must close the socket handed to it.

// closeTracker is a PacketConn that records whether it was closed, so the test
// can assert kcp closed it rather than inferring it from a rebind.
