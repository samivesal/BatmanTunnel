// Authorising pool connections by what the peer knows, not where it dials from.
//
// A tunnel is a control channel plus a pool of data connections, and the data
// connections used to prove nothing at all: they were accepted purely because
// their source address matched the control channel's. That works on a client
// with one stable egress address and silently fails everywhere else — behind
// carrier-grade NAT, on a multi-homed host, behind a SNAT pool or a
// load-balanced gateway, the pool dials out from a different address than the
// control channel did and the server discards every one of them. The tunnel
// reports itself connected, because the control channel is fine, and then
// carries no traffic. It is the same shape of failure whichever way it lands:
// something about the *network path* decides whether the tunnel works, with no
// error that names the cause.
//
// So the server hands the client a fresh random nonce when the control channel
// comes up, and each pool connection presents it. The nonce is per run — a new
// one on every control channel — so it cannot be replayed into a later run, and
// it is never written anywhere the token is not already. Source address stops
// being part of the decision, which is what lets a client behind any of the
// above work exactly like one with a single static IP.

// poolNonceBytes is the size of the random value; poolNonceHexLen is its length
// once hex encoded, which is what actually travels and what Decode splits on.
