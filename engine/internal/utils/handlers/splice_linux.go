// Moving bytes between two sockets without copying them into user space.
//
// A relay's cost is not arithmetic, it is touching the data. The buffered path
// reads a chunk out of the kernel into a Go slice and immediately writes the
// same bytes back into the kernel — two syscalls and two copies for every
// chunk, to hand over bytes it never looks at. splice(2) says the same thing to
// the kernel directly: move this socket's data to that socket. The bytes never
// leave kernel memory, and on the small VPS this tunnel usually runs on, where
// the CPU is what runs out before the link does, that is the difference between
// saturating an uplink and not.
//
// Why this is written out rather than left to io.Copy, which would splice by
// itself: io.Copy hands the kernel the whole stream and does not come back
// until it ends. The tunnel would then be unable to say how much it had carried
// until each connection closed, and the panel would show a running download as
// an idle tunnel — which is exactly the failure the live counters were added to
// prevent. Driving the loop here means the transfer is still one uninterrupted
// splice as far as latency is concerned, one chunk moved as soon as it arrives,
// while every chunk is still counted as it goes.
//
// It fails safe in the strongest sense available: until the first byte moves,
// any refusal — no pipe, a kernel that will not splice this socket type, a
// sandbox that forbids it — is reported as "not handled" with nothing
// consumed, and the caller silently does the buffered copy instead. The worst
// case is the performance we had before, never a broken tunnel.

// spliceChunk is the most to move in one go. The kernel caps a single splice at
// the pipe's capacity, so the pipe is grown to match; a request larger than the
// pipe simply moves less, which the loop handles anyway.
const spliceChunk = 1 << 20 // 1 MiB

// spliceRelay moves everything readable from src into dst until src ends,
// reporting each chunk through onChunk as it moves.
//
// handled is false only when splice never got started and nothing was
// consumed, which is the caller's signal to fall back to a buffered copy.
