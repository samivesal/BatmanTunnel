// Measured, 2026-09-21, on loopback with a plain tcp tunnel and no bandwidth
// limit — the only shape this path applies to:
//
//	buffered    8419 Mbit/s
//	splice     10813 Mbit/s      +28%
//
// Reproduce with:
//
//	go test ./internal/e2e/ -run TestSpliceThroughput -v -count=1
//
// Read it with the loopback in mind. splice saves a copy between two sockets
// and the kernel; on loopback that copy is cheap and the syscall overhead
// dominates, so this is a lower bound on what a real NIC would show — a gain
// here is conservative, and a loss here would have been damning.
//
// **The default stays off, deliberately, and this is the decision rather than
// an absence of one.** A 28% gain on a synthetic path is evidence that the
// implementation works, not that it is ready to be everybody's default on
// upgrade. What would justify flipping it is field evidence: the same
// measurement on a real link, and a soak with it enabled. Until then the switch
// is one line in a config and the number above is what an operator needs to
// decide for themselves.

// Zero-copy forwarding is off until somebody asks for it.
//
// The kernel path is the fastest thing in this system and the least proven: it
// moves the bytes of every forwarded connection without the process ever seeing
// them, which is exactly why it is quick and exactly why a mistake in it would
// be invisible until traffic was already corrupt. The buffered path it replaces
// has carried real traffic for a long time.
//
// So it is opt-in, per tunnel. An operator with a busy tunnel and a spare one
// can turn it on for the spare, watch the counters below, and leave the busy
// one alone — rather than choosing between the speed and the risk for
// everything at once.
//
// It is also purely local. Nothing about it appears on the wire, so the two
// ends of a tunnel need not agree: one may use the kernel while the other
// copies in user space, and neither can tell. That is what makes it safe to
// enable on one side first.

// "Enabled" does not mean "used": the kernel path needs two plain TCP sockets
// and a kernel willing to splice them, and it silently declines otherwise — on
// a mux or websocket transport, on a bandwidth-limited tunnel, off Linux. An
// operator who turned it on deserves to know which of those happened, and a
// bug report saying "enabled, and every connection fell back" is worth far more
// than one saying "I turned it on".
