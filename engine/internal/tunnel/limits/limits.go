// Package limits caps what one tunnel may use.
//
// A tunnel is often shared: several services behind one server, or several
// customers behind one panel. Without limits a single greedy connection can
// take the whole link, and a burst of connections can exhaust what every other
// user depends on. Two caps, deliberately simple — a ceiling on concurrent
// forwarded connections, and a ceiling on throughput.
//
// Both are off by default. A limit nobody asked for is a bug report waiting to
// happen, so zero always means unlimited, and an unlimited tunnel pays nothing
// but a nil check.
//
// The reverse transports have an equivalent of their own, unexported in
// internal/server/transport. This is a second implementation rather than a
// shared one because merging them would mean editing the reverse data path,
// and these caps are not worth that risk. The two are small, they do the same
// arithmetic, and either can be changed without the other.
