// The cryptographic session.
//
// The handshake is Noise NNpsk0 with the pre-shared key derived from the
// tunnel token, which is the same construction the stealth transport uses over
// TCP. Everything below it differs, because a datagram carrier breaks the two
// assumptions a record layer over TCP gets for free: that messages arrive, and
// that they arrive in order.
//
// What follows from that:
//
//   - The nonce is explicit, carried in the header, rather than an implicit
//     counter both ends increment in step. A single lost datagram would
//     desynchronise an implicit counter permanently.
//   - Decryption goes through noise.Cipher rather than noise.CipherState.
//     CipherState owns an internal nonce and insists messages be decrypted in
//     the order they were encrypted; Cipher takes the nonce as an argument.
//     The library documents this as the intended path for "a network protocol
//     that can deliver out-of-order messages", which is exactly this one.
//   - Every accepted counter is recorded in a replay window. See replay.go.
//   - The handshake retransmits, because its messages can be lost like any
//     other datagram.
//
// # Domain separation
//
// The prologue and the key-derivation label below are specific to this
// protocol and differ from the stealth transport's. Two consequences, both
// intended: a handshake captured from a stealth connection cannot be replayed
// into an l3 tunnel or the reverse, and the two protocols derive different
// keys from the same token, so neither can decrypt the other even in
// principle. This is why the handshake is written out again here instead of
// being lifted from internal/utils/network — the duplication is the point.

	l3PSKLabel = "backpack-l3-psk-v1"

// Session lifetime.
//
// The message limits sit far below the 2^64 ceiling the nonce imposes, so
// exhaustion is something the rekey timer prevents rather than something the
// data path has to survive. The time limits are what actually fire in
// practice: a busy tunnel rekeys every two minutes, which bounds how much

// Agreeing on the encapsulation, in the handshake.
//
// The two ends must wrap packets the same way, and until this existed nothing
// checked that they did. A tunnel whose ends disagreed came up perfectly: the
// handshake has no encapsulation in it, so the keys matched, the session was
// established, the peer was reported, and the panel went green on both
// machines. Then every single data packet decrypted correctly and was thrown
// away one layer later, because an IPIP sender's payload is an IP packet and a
// GRE receiver reads the first four bytes of it as a GRE header.
//
// The symptom is a tunnel that is up, has a peer, logs no errors above debug,
// and moves nothing at all. It was found in the field, on a pair of servers
// where one end had been set up with IPIP and the other with GRE, and it cost
// an afternoon because every diagnostic said the tunnel was fine.
//
// So the identifier travels in the handshake payload, which Noise encrypts and
// authenticates along with everything else, and a mismatch is refused by name
// on both ends. It is the same reasoning that made the token asymmetric in the
// wizard: two values that must match, and silence when they do not, is a
