// Refusing a handshake that has been seen before.
//
// The layer-3 handshake is Noise NNpsk0 and carries no freshness of any kind:
// the initiator's payload holds the encapsulation identifier and nothing else,
// so a recorded typeInit datagram stays valid for ever and the responder cannot
// tell a replay from a first contact. Half the consequence is already closed —
// a replay can no longer take over an established peer — and the other half
// stands: it can still displace a genuine *pending* session, and the genuine
// peer's data packets then find no session and are dropped. One recorded
// packet, reusable indefinitely, keeps a tunnel from establishing.
//
// # And the timestamp
//
// The proper fix is WireGuard's — a timestamp inside the encrypted payload,
// refused unless it advances — and it is protocol version 2, in freshness.go.
// This memory stays: it costs nothing, it covers the legacy handshake an older
// dialler still sends, and it turns a flood of one replayed packet into one
// answer.
//
// # What this does instead, and what it is worth
//
// The initiator picks a random 32-bit session identifier per handshake and it
// already travels in the header. A replay carries the identifier it was
// recorded with. Remembering the ones recently answered therefore refuses a
// replayed handshake with no wire change at all.
//
// It is bounded and it is honest about what it covers. A replay of an init
// older than the window is still accepted, so this is not the timestamp. What
// it does close is the practical attack: an attacker with one recorded packet
// replaying it repeatedly to keep a tunnel down. Under this, the first copy is
// answered and every copy after it inside the window is not — so the flood
// costs the attacker a packet and buys nothing.

	// initMemory is how many recently answered handshakes are remembered.

	// The dialling side rekeys every two minutes, so a handful covers several
	// rekeys with room for the retransmissions each one may produce. It is

	// collision — a genuine handshake refused as a replay — more likely than
	// the attack being prevented.
