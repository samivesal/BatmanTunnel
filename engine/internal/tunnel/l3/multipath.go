// Several sockets instead of one, as a carrier that wraps carriers.
//
// A tunnel on one UDP socket is one 5-tuple, and a 5-tuple is what a shaper
// counts. Where a provider rate-limits per flow — which is the ordinary way a
// consumer link and a good many transit paths behave — the whole tunnel gets
// one flow's allowance no matter how much headroom the link has. Spreading the
// same traffic over several sockets makes it several flows, and several flows
// get several allowances. It also gives the kernel more than one queue to work
// with, which matters once the packet rate is high enough to be the limit.
//
// The ports are derived, not negotiated: the base port is the one in the
// configuration and the paths take the next ones in order, so both ends arrive
// at the same set from the same file. A tunnel with paths = 4 on port 9000 uses
// 9000-9003 and needs those open.
//
// # Why this is not offered for the spoof carrier
//
// It would add almost nothing there. The forged-source carrier already varies
// its source port on every packet (spoof_shuffle_port) and rotates through a
// pool of source addresses (spoof_src_pool), so a shaper counting flows already
// sees many. Adding sockets underneath that would multiply the machinery
// without multiplying the effect it is for.
//
// # What it does not do
//
// It adds nothing to the wire — no header, no identifier, so Overhead() is the
// carrier's own and the MTU is unchanged. It makes no attempt to balance by
// measured quality: paths are used in turn, which is what spreads a flow
// counter evenly and is the whole point. And it does not reorder deliberately,
// though several paths do arrive interleaved — the tunnel's replay window above
// is what absorbs that, and it is why paths are capped well below the width of
// that window.

// maxPaths caps how many sockets a tunnel may spread over.
//
// The ceiling is not arbitrary: every extra path widens the reordering the
// receiver sees, and the sealed layer above only accepts a counter inside its
// replay window. Eight interleaved paths is comfortably inside it, and a tunnel
// that needs more than eight flows to get its bandwidth has a problem no number
// of sockets will fix.
const maxPaths = 8

// pathQueue is how many received datagrams may wait ahead of the reader before
// the pumps start dropping. A datagram carrier is allowed to drop — the layer
// above is built for it — and dropping is better than a pump stalling and
// leaving one path's packets stuck behind another's.
