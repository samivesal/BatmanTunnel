// Choosing which backend a forwarded connection goes to.
//
// A mapping with several backends is how one Iran server spreads a port over
// several kharej servers: each kharej has its own layer-3 tunnel, the kernel
// routes each peer address over its own interface, and the mapping lists them
// all ("443=10.10.0.2:443|10.10.1.2:443"). Two things decide how well that
// works, and round robin got both wrong.
//
// Bandwidth. Connections are not equal — one download can outweigh a hundred
// page loads — so taking turns leaves one kharej saturated while another idles.
// Each new connection goes to the member with the fewest connections open now,
// which is what spreads the load that is actually there.
//
// A member that has died. Over a layer-3 tunnel whose far end is gone the
// kernel still routes into the interface, so a dial is not refused — it hangs
// until it times out. Round robin sent every n-th connection into that hang,
// for the full ten seconds, for as long as the member stayed down. A member
// whose dial fails is now set aside for backendCooldown and only tried again
// when that has passed or when nothing else answers, and while there is
// another member left to try a dial gives up after memberDialTimeout.
