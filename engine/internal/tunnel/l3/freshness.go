// Freshness in the handshake: protocol version 2.
//
// The layer-3 handshake is Noise NNpsk0, and its first message carried nothing
// that changes over time, so a recorded one stayed valid for ever. initreplay.go
// stops the same one being replayed inside ten minutes; this closes the rest.
// It is WireGuard's rule: the dialler puts a timestamp inside the encrypted,
// authenticated first message, and the listener refuses one that is not newer
// than the last it accepted. A recorded handshake is then worthless the moment
// a newer one has been seen, and the one piece of the message that would have
// to change to revive it is the piece nobody without the token can write.
//
// # Why it could not ship before, and how it ships now
//
// A listener before v2 compares the dialler's payload whole against its own
// encapsulation, so a payload with anything after the encapsulation is refused
// by every listener already in the field — and the header, where a version
// could be announced for free, is not authenticated, so nothing that matters
// can live there. What makes it shippable is that the refusal is not silent: a
// listener that holds the token answers a mismatched payload with a reply
// naming its own encapsulation, so that both logs can say what is wrong (see
// respondFresh). That reply is encrypted under the handshake, and only a holder
// of the token can produce it.
//
// So a v2 dialler tries the timestamp first. A v2 listener accepts it. An older
// one refuses it with an authenticated reply that carries no version block, and
// the dialler — on that reply and on nothing weaker — falls back to the legacy
// payload for a while, then tries v2 again in case the listener was upgraded.
// Something on the path cannot cause the fallback: it can drop the timestamped
// attempt, but a dropped attempt is retried, not given up on, and it cannot
// write the reply that is the only thing a fallback is taken on.
//
// A v2 listener that has once accepted a timestamp refuses a legacy payload
// from then on. Without that, the recorded handshakes of the dialler's *old*
// build would stay replayable against the new listener for ever, which is the
// hole this exists to close.
//
// # Clocks
//
// The timestamp is the dialler's wall clock in nanoseconds, forced to rise by at
// least one per handshake, and the listener compares it only with what the
// same dialler sent before. The two machines' clocks never have to agree. The
// one thing that would hurt is the dialler's clock stepping backwards by more
// than the gap between two handshakes; a listener restart forgets what it saw
// and accepts the next timestamp whatever it is, which is what makes that
// recoverable.

// freshSep separates the encapsulation from the timestamp in the payload. The
// same separator the reply's version block uses, so neither can be mistaken for
// part of an encapsulation name.
const freshSep = versionSep + "t"

// legacyRetry is how long a dialler that met an old listener keeps using the
// legacy payload before trying v2 again. Each try costs the old listener one
// line in its log, so not every rekey.
const legacyRetry = 30 * time.Minute

// clockStepGrace is how long a listener with no session goes on refusing a
// dialler's stamps as too old before it takes them as the dialler's clock
// having gone back. See freshJudge.stale. A variable so a test can shorten it.

// timestamps. The dialler falls back and tries again at once.

// packet (adopt, from promote). A recorded handshake is answered like any

// restarted. Reported from the field on v1.8.3 as "a direct tunnel stops
// working after a while".
