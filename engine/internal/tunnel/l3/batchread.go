// Reading several datagrams per syscall.
//
// The receive pump used to read the carrier one datagram at a time, and the
// comment there explained why it could not do otherwise: the send path batches
// because one tun.Read hands back several packets, and there is no equivalent
// on the way in without either blocking on a read that may not come or holding
// packets on a timer. Both trade latency for syscalls on the path where latency
// is the thing being protected.
//
// That reasoning is sound and it does not apply to recvmmsg, which is the whole
// point of it. recvmmsg blocks exactly as long as a single recvfrom would — until
// the first datagram — and then takes whatever else has already arrived without
// waiting for it. An idle tunnel pays nothing: one datagram arrives, one
// datagram comes back, and the call returns. A busy tunnel pays one syscall for
// a burst instead of one per packet. There is no timer and no added latency,
// which is why this is the one batching change worth making here.
//
// It is a capability, not a requirement. Only the plain UDP carrier has a
// socket recvmmsg can be pointed at; the obfuscated, QUIC, SNI and multipath
// carriers each do their own work per datagram and are left reading one at a
// time, which is what they did before.
//
// # Measured
//
// 40,000 1200-byte datagrams at a loopback carrier, 2026-09-21
// (TestBatchReceiveRate):
//
//	one by one   27,682 of 40,000 received,  59 kpps
//	recvmmsg     40,000 of 40,000 received, 214 kpps
//
// The rate is the smaller half of that result. The larger half is the first
// column: reading one at a time, the receive side could not keep up with the
// sender and the socket dropped 12,318 datagrams — nearly a third — while the
// batched path took every one. A tunnel losing packets because its own receive
// loop is behind looks exactly like a lossy path from the outside, which is the
// most expensive kind of fault to diagnose.

// batchSize is how many datagrams one recvmmsg may gather.
//
// The kernel fills as many as have arrived and returns; a larger array costs
// only the address space it occupies, and the pump holds one buffer of
// maxMTU+256 per slot.
//
// It was eight, on the argument that the syscall saving flattens out by then.
// That was an argument rather than a measurement, and the send side has since
// shown how wrong an argument about syscalls can be. Measured instead
// (TestBatchWidth, four widths, three runs):
//
//	width   1    ~50 kpps, and only half the datagrams arrive
//	width   8   ~225 kpps
//	width  32   ~300 kpps
//	width 128   ~275 kpps
//
// Thirty-two is the peak rather than a compromise: a hundred and twenty-eight
// is no faster and sometimes slower, and it would cost 900 KB more of buffers
// per tunnel — putting the pump's own allocation over a megabyte, the figure
// this constant was first written to stay under.
//
// The batch rarely *fills* at any width — two to four datagrams per call,
// because the reader keeps up — so the gain is not in gathering more. It is in
// taking an occasional burst in one call instead of two, and in the first row:
// a reader taking one datagram at a time cannot keep up at all, and the socket
// drops nearly half of them.
const batchSize = 32

// batchWriter is the same capability in the other direction: several datagrams
// on the wire from one syscall.
//
// The send path is the side that already has a batch in hand. tun.Read returns
// as many packets as the kernel had ready, they are all sealed in the same
// loop, and they are all going to the same peer — so the gather costs nothing
// to arrange. Each one was then written with its own syscall anyway.
