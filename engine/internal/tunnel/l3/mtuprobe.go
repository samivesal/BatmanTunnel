// Measuring the path instead of guessing at it.
//
// The MTU is the one setting on a layer-3 tunnel that cannot be worked out from
// the configuration, and the one that fails worst when it is wrong. Set it too
// high and the tunnel comes up, passes every liveness check, carries ping and
// SSH — and stalls every download and every TLS handshake, because the packets
// that matter are the large ones and they are dropped somewhere out on the path
// with no message coming back.
//
// Until this existed the engine printed a guess: "a 1500-byte path fits 1415".
// That guess assumes the whole route carries 1500 bytes, which a real route
// frequently does not — a PPPoE hop, an encapsulating provider, a tunnel
// upstream. On one pair of servers the real figure was 1371 against a
// configured 1400, and the 29-byte difference cost an afternoon: everything
// looked healthy and nothing worked.
//
// So the tunnel measures it. Once a session is up, it binary-searches for the
// largest packet the path will actually carry, and sets the interface to match.
//
// # Why each end measures only its own sending direction
//
// A path can carry more one way than the other, and what an interface MTU
// governs is what this host may send. Forcing both ends onto a single shared
// figure would mean the better direction is throttled to the worse one for no
// reason. So each end probes outward and sets its own interface, which is both
// simpler — nothing has to be negotiated — and more accurate.
//
// # Why the probe has to be padded
//
// A data message carrying an inner packet of P bytes costs, on the wire:
//
//	carrier + headerLen + (encapOverhead + P) + tagLen
//
// The probe is padded so its own wire size is exactly that. A smaller probe
// would arrive when a real packet of the size being tested would not, and the
// tunnel would conclude the path is wider than it is — which is the failure
// this exists to prevent, arrived at by a different route.
//
// # Safety
//
// Probes are sealed under the session, so only a peer holding the token can
// answer one, and nobody else can push this tunnel's MTU around. A peer built
// before probes existed does not recognise the message kind and drops it; the
// search then finds nothing and the configured MTU is left exactly as it was.
