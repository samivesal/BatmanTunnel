// A connection slot taken on accept has to be given back on every path out.
//
// Each of these transports reserves a slot the moment it accepts a forwarded
// connection — deliberately, so a refused connection is refused before it costs
// anything — and the handler goroutine gives it back when the transfer ends.
// The pairing timeout is the path where that goroutine never runs: the client
// waited three seconds for a tunnel connection, none arrived, and the
// connection is closed without ever being handed to a handler.
//
// tcp and quic freed the slot there. tcpmux, wsmux, kcp and ws did not, so a
// tunnel with max_connections set lost a slot to every timeout and eventually
// refused everything, with a limit that looked correct in the config and a
// panel that showed no connections at all. The shape is identical in all six
// and the bug was in four of them, which is the argument for checking them
// together rather than one at a time.
