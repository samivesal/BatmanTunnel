// momentarily empty, and always happens when traffic arrives before the client
// has finished connecting.
//
// Giving up has to mean giving up on the whole flow. It used to stop working on
// it while leaving the source address in the table, and nothing else ever
// removed that entry: every later datagram from that peer was filed against a
// payload channel no goroutine was reading, so the peer went silent for good
// and only a service restart brought it back. That is the "UDP worked, then
// stopped" report. Here the entry has to be gone, so the peer's next datagram
// starts a fresh flow.
