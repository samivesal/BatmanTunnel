// muxSession.failed, on the three transports that multiplex.
//
// It runs on a session goroutine that has just failed and is about to return,
// and it has three jobs: give back the session count, put the connection it was
// carrying back on the queue, and ask for a replacement. Getting any of them
// wrong is a leak that only shows up on a session that dies — which is rare
// enough that the end-to-end suite never reached this function on any of the
// three.
//
// The counters matter because the mux transports block on them. A session count
// that is never decremented is a session slot gone for the life of the run; a
// stream count that drifts the other way lets a session take more streams than
// MuxCon allows.

// sessionErrorSubject is the shape the three transports share here.
