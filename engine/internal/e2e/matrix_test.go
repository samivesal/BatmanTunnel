// One place that answers "does every transport still carry traffic".
//
// The suite already exercises most of them, spread across a dozen files that
// each ask a narrower question — loss recovery, mux versions, TLS, the pool.
// What it did not have is the flat answer: for every transport this build
// ships, does a tunnel come up and do bytes survive the round trip. That is the
// question asked after any change to the data path, and answering it meant
// reading the transport list out of six files and hoping none had been missed.
//
// tcpTransports in transport_test.go lists seven. The full set is ten, and the
// three it leaves out are not exotic: wss and wssmux terminate TLS, and udp
// carries datagrams. Each has its own file for its own reason; none of them
// appeared in a list of "every transport".
//
// The raw-socket carriers — xdi, pck, spoof, sni — are deliberately absent.
// They need CAP_NET_RAW and a packet socket, which a test process does not
// have, and pretending otherwise with a skip that never runs would be worse
// than saying so here. They are exercised in a network namespace instead; see
// docs and the spoof tester.

// with that can run without elevated privileges.
